Implement a template based Queue using a dynamic array which supports the enqueue, dequeue and front operations.    					      15

Implement Template based Stack using a singly linked-list.                	      15

Write a program to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression. The expression will contain the following characters [ a-z , + , - , * , / , ( , ) ].             15

Sample Input
Sample Output
a+(b+c)*d-e
abc+d*+e-
(a+b)*(c+d)
ab+cd+*


Evaluate it using stack. All the numbers are single digit numbers in the input so you don’t have to worry about multi digit numbers.				      15
Sample Input
Sample Output
4+(5+6)*8-1
91
(2+4)*(5+6)
66

Congratulations you just built a mini calculator if you solved it correctly.

Implement Template based Deque using a doubly linked-list which supports push_front, push_back, pop_back, pop_front, front, back operations.   	      15

Given a string, check if it's a palindrome using a Deque.   			      15
Sample Input
Sample Output
abcba
Yes
abcca
No

	Hint: Check the first and last character. If they are equal then pop them and continue this process until the string becomes empty.

Write a function void deleteValue(list<int> & l , int value)’ -> This function will delete the first occurrence of the element that is equal to the input value from the stl list. 										      10
Sample Input: STL list containing [7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 4], value : 4
Sample Output: STL list containing [7, 3, 8, 5, 4]
